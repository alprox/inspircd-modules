### m_censor
m_censor that does not censor http protocol links.

### m_translate
automatic message translation courtesy of Bing translator! you have to input
your Azure API key in to the source file, at the moment. see source for details.
depencies are POCO libraries and pugixml. don't know if this could be more
elegant with fewer depencies. unfortunately they, there at microsoft, have
decided to serve the translations with some sort of a RSS feed xml thingy so
don't know about the elegancy possibility!

compiles for 2.0.15 and probably other versions I have not tested
